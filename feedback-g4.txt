    images/icons/
    listings/*.bib

    bib-files.txt
    missfont.log
    README.txt

  \parencite{1}  ??
  \parencite{2}


o Where is your own bib file ??





o bulleted list

If a programmer wants his web site to be responsive, he has to use 
following techniques:

$\bullet$ Media queries 

$\bullet$ Flexible images and media

$\bullet$ Fluid grid layouts




o Never use newlines  \\

o Never use \newpage


o always use [tp] for floats

  \begin{figure}[h!]




o p 2  listings should be numbered (= floats)



o p 9  listing cut in two



o p 11  single line of flowing text




o p 21, 23, 25 ...   figures have no captions



o p 28  Fig 4.8  way too big



o All figures must be referred to in the running text.




o define macro for HTML elements  based on my \vname macro

  \textit{<table>}    \elname{}


o define macro for CSS properties

   \propname{}




o survey-tables.tex   tabs in listing



o why do examples use px   should be responsive









Presentation / Code
-------------------



o  why node_modules ?

no package.json file

Remove any dependency on npm and include
necessary packages directly !!

<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/tablesaw/dist/tablesaw.css">




o include libraries locally, not over http

<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.2/css/jquery.dataTables.min.css">

<script type="text/javascript"  src="http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>






o Why is bootstrap needed?



o Include unminified libraries as well (for me to read / debug)



o very messy  not clear which libraries are needed for what






o xmp is obsolete in HTML5

<xmp><table></xmp>






o does not validate  203 errors found !!



e.g. at bottom of index.html


<section>
  <h1>Recommendation</h1>

    For responsive design and techniques we recommend:<br><br>
<ul>


<td role="cell" >  ??
