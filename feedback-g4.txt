Presentation / Code
-------------------



o  why node_modules ?

no package.json file

Remove any dependency on npm and include
necessary packages directly !!

<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/tablesaw/dist/tablesaw.css">




o include libraries locally, not over http

<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.2/css/jquery.dataTables.min.css">

<script type="text/javascript"  src="http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>






o Why is bootstrap needed?



o Include unminified libraries as well (for me to read / debug)



o very messy  not clear which libraries are needed for what






o xmp is obsolete in HTML5

<xmp><table></xmp>






o does not validate  203 errors found !!



e.g. at bottom of index.html


<section>
  <h1>Recommendation</h1>

    For responsive design and techniques we recommend:<br><br>
<ul>


<td role="cell" >  ??
